Opencv Face Landmark Detection 
Facial landmark detection is a computer vision task in which a model needs to predict key points representing regions or landmarks on a human’s face – eyes, nose, lips, and others. Facial landmark detection is a base task which can be used to perform other computer vision tasks, including head pose estimation, identifying gaze direction, detecting facial gestures, and swapping faces.
